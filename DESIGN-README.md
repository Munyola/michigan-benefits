# Day-to-Day

## Communication

Design communication is done primarily via:

* Slack
* Invision
* Trello

## Design Files
Latest design files should be pushed to your branch daily to be kept up to date and accessible to other designers.

## Front-End Design Contribution
Please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/codeforamerica/michigan-benefits/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the process for code contribution and submitting pull request.

## Workflow
* A design feature or change is initiated and discussed via a Trello card.
* All new Trello cards are added to the "Design/UI Backlog" Trello list.
* During a weekly planning meeting, prioritized Trello cards are added to the "Next Up" Trello list. Cards in this list should have enough detail to be actionable. Top priority items are at the top of the list.
* When someone starts working on a task, they move the Trello card into "In Progress" and assign themselves so that others know they are working on it.
* When finished, the designer should request a review on Trello (for visual design) or GitHub (for front-end design) by the product manager or another designer.
